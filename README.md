Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

#### ðŸ¤” What to do after cloning this repository?

Once you've cloned the project:

-  Run `npm run test` (hopefully all tests will be green)
-  Run `npm run dev` (if you wish to run the project locally)
