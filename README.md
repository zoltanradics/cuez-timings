## Zoltan Radics's Svelte homework for Cuez.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

#### 🤔 What to do after cloning this repository?

Once you've cloned the project:

-  Run `npm ci`. (if you don't know why, ask me next time we talk)
-  Run `npm run test` (hopefully all tests will be green)
-  Run `npm run dev` (if you wish to run the project locally)

#### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
